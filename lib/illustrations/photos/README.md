# Photo curation guide

This directory holds the 50 stock photos used as decorative photography on
PPTX `concept`, `example`, and `warmUp` slides. Photos are referenced
deterministically by `lib/illustrations/photos.js` — the same Lesson
always picks the same photos for the same slots — so curation only needs
to happen once per refresh.

**The picker handles missing files gracefully** — slides render with a
"ghost frame" placeholder where a photo would land, so the deck still
works end-to-end before any photo lands here. Drop in the JPGs as you
source them.

## Directory layout

50 photos split across 6 subject categories. Create the subdirectories
and drop the JPGs in with sequential `NN.jpg` names:

```
photos/
  mathematics/   01.jpg  02.jpg  03.jpg  04.jpg  05.jpg  06.jpg  07.jpg  08.jpg
  sciences/      01.jpg  02.jpg  03.jpg  04.jpg  05.jpg  06.jpg  07.jpg  08.jpg  09.jpg
  geography/     01.jpg  02.jpg  03.jpg  04.jpg  05.jpg  06.jpg  07.jpg  08.jpg
  languages/     01.jpg  02.jpg  03.jpg  04.jpg  05.jpg  06.jpg  07.jpg  08.jpg  09.jpg
  history/       01.jpg  02.jpg  03.jpg  04.jpg  05.jpg  06.jpg  07.jpg  08.jpg
  lifeskills/    01.jpg  02.jpg  03.jpg  04.jpg  05.jpg  06.jpg  07.jpg  08.jpg
```

The `lifeskills` bucket also serves Life Orientation and EMS — those
subjects map there in `lib/illustrations/photos.js → categoryFor()`.

If you change the slot counts, also update `PHOTO_CATEGORIES` in
`lib/illustrations/photos.js` so the picker knows how far to index.

## Licensing — only use photos with explicit free-commercial licenses

The lesson DOCX/PPTX is downloaded by the teacher and may end up
anywhere. Every photo here must be safe for that distribution.

**Recommended sources** (all free for commercial use, no attribution
required, modify freely):

- **Unsplash** — <https://unsplash.com> · Unsplash License
- **Pexels** — <https://pexels.com> · Pexels License
- **Pixabay** — <https://pixabay.com> · Pixabay Content License

**Do NOT use:**

- Google Image search results
- Flickr photos under restrictive Creative Commons (CC-BY-NC, CC-BY-SA, etc.)
- Anything from a stock site that requires attribution or charges per use
  (Getty, Shutterstock, Adobe Stock — unless we have a paid licence)
- AI-generated photos (commercial-use IP is still grey for most tools)

Save the source URL + license confirmation alongside each photo (you
can keep a `_credits.txt` file in this directory — gitignored — for
your own records).

## Sizing & format

- **Format:** JPG (smaller than PNG for photographic content)
- **Resolution:** ~1200×800 px (3:2) is the target. Anything between
  1000×667 and 1600×1067 is fine. Photos are cropped to a 3.3"×4.6"
  PPTX box on widescreen slides — providing more pixels than that just
  bloats the file.
- **File size:** aim for ~150–300 KB each. The whole library should fit
  inside ~10 MB total. Use `convert` / `magick` / online JPG compressor
  if photos run heavy.
- **Aspect:** prefer **portrait or square** orientation — the photo box
  on the slide is taller than wide. Wide landscape photos crop awkwardly.

## Content guidelines

- **Kid-appropriate.** No adult or distressing content. Photos featuring
  children should look natural, not posed-stock-photo cringe.
- **Representation.** South African classrooms are diverse — pick
  photos that reflect that across the library. Search Unsplash for
  `african children`, `south africa school`, `cape town`, `diverse
  classroom` for SA-leaning shots.
- **Avoid the obvious clichés.** A search for "Mathematics" returns mostly
  chalkboards covered in equations. Those photos are fine for variety
  but don't make the whole maths bucket chalkboard-only — mix in
  hands-on shots (counting blocks, money, measuring), abstract
  geometry, books with rulers, etc.
- **Subject relevance** — photos should evoke the subject, not literally
  illustrate the lesson topic (the model picks topics dynamically; the
  photo is decorative).

## Per-category search prompts

Suggested search terms to seed your curation (mix-and-match across
sources):

| Category | Search terms |
|---|---|
| `mathematics` | `numbers`, `counting`, `geometry`, `measuring tape`, `kids math`, `chalkboard equation`, `abacus`, `puzzle pieces`, `building blocks` |
| `sciences` | `science kid`, `magnifying glass`, `plants kids`, `microscope`, `nature outdoors`, `biology classroom`, `experiment`, `solar system`, `weather` |
| `geography` | `map`, `globe`, `cape town`, `africa landscape`, `compass`, `mountains`, `rivers`, `aerial view land`, `desert savanna` |
| `languages` | `child reading`, `library books`, `pencil writing`, `reading aloud`, `storytelling`, `book pages open`, `kids writing`, `journaling` |
| `history` | `old map`, `ancient artifacts`, `historic building`, `museum`, `cape dutch architecture`, `vintage objects`, `parchment`, `old photographs sepia` |
| `lifeskills` | `kids playing outside`, `team sports kids`, `family meal`, `helping hands`, `community garden`, `friends laughing`, `first aid kit`, `healthy food` |

## After dropping photos in

The picker reads from disk at render time — no rebuild needed. Generate
a Lesson and verify the photos appear on `concept` / `example` / `warmUp`
slides. If you want to swap or refresh a photo, just replace the file
on disk; the next generation will pick it up (cache permitting — bump
the cache version if you want to force re-renders).

## Phase D v2 ideas (post-validation)

- Per-grade-band photo sub-buckets (junior gets brighter / character
  shots, senior gets cleaner / more neutral compositions)
- Per-language buckets (an Afrikaans Lesson could pull from a small
  SA-specific sub-library)
- Hand-curated SA-specific top-up library (~10–20 photos paid via
  iAfrica or Africa Media Online if generic stock starts feeling off)
